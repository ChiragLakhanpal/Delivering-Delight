<p style="font-size: 17px"> Are you tired of waiting for your food delivery to arrive while your stomach growls in protest? Well, what if I told you that there's a dataset out there that could help predict delivery times for all your favorite food delivery services? Enter the "Delivery Duration Prediction" dataset.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px"> This dataset contains information about over 2 Million food deliveries, including the time of day, the distance between the restaurant and customer, the food preparation time, and the actual delivery time. With all this data, it's possible to build a predictive model that could help estimate how long it will take for your next meal to arrive at your doorstep.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px"> Whether you're a foodie, a data scientist, or just someone who hates waiting for food, this dataset is sure to pique your interest. So why not take a closer look and see what insights we can uncover?</p>
